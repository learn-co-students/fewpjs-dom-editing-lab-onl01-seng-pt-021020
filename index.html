  <h1>My HTML adventure</h1>
  <p>
    We're writing HTML markup to display in our <strong>browser</strong>.
    We're basically telling computers what to do. <em>Neat!</em>
    We're writing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> markup to display in our <strong>browser</strong>.
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Element name</th>
        <th>Display value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>h1</td>
        <td>block</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>p</td>
        <td>block</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>strong</td>
        <td>inline</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>em</td>
        <td>inline</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  Woah. That's a lot of markup! If you take a look at the result though, you'll see that it's a fairly complex visual â€” it's a table! Our table consists of a header and a body. The header allows us to give the columns a name, and the table body contains the rows of content. Both <thead> and <tbody> tags contains rows, which are represented as <tr> (table row). These rows then contain columns (or cells). In the <thead> row, cells are represented as <th>, while cells in <tbody> have their content in <td> tags.
  
  That's a lot of nesting.
  
  Look again at the Elements tab. Expand out all the children of the table. This is the DOM tree!
  
  Moving On
